# Battleship
Battleship-like game where the player plays against the computer. Both the player and the computer have a set of battleships that they will place on separate boards. After the battleships are placed, they each take a turn to hit a square on the map. The player that manages to hit all the squares occupied by the oponent's ships wins.
